# spin-loader-while-contents-load

Spin Loader While Contents Load is a project that aims to enhance the user experience by providing a visually appealing loading spinner while the contents of a large webpage are being loaded. This creates a more pleasant experience for users, as they are provided with visual feedback that the page is loading, rather than staring at a blank screen.

## Features

- Display a spinning loader animation while the contents of the webpage are loading.
- Enhance user experience by providing visual feedback during the loading process.
- Easy integration into existing web projects.
